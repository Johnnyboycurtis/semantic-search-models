# Semantic Search Models

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A repository for building, training, and sharing models for semantic search using the `sentence-transformers` library.

## About This Project

This project is dedicated to creating high-performance models for modern search systems. It provides two key components:

*   **Pre-trained Models:** A collection of sentence embedding models for efficient retrieval and cross-encoder models for accurate reranking.
*   **Training Blueprints:** The complete scripts, dataset details, and documentation showing how each model was trained, allowing you to reproduce the results or build your own.

The goal is to provide both ready-to-use artifacts and a clear, open-source reference for training your own state-of-the-art semantic search models.

## Project Goals

*   [ ] Release initial versions of a general-purpose sentence embedding model.
*   [ ] Release an accompanying cross-encoder reranking model.
*   [ ] Publish the training scripts and configurations for all released models.
*   [ ] Add performance benchmarks on common information retrieval tasks.
